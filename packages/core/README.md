# MondoKit Core

Core library components that are not bound to any cloud provider. If you are using other libraries in `@mondokit`, then it is unlikely that you will need to depend on
this directly as it is likely referenced, and relevant utilities exported, via cloud-specific libraries such as `@mondokit/gcp-core`.
