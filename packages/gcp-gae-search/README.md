# GAE JS SEARCH

SearchService implementation that uses the GAE Search API via the
[https://github.com/mondo-mob/gae-search-service](https://github.com/mondo-mob/gae-search-service) GAE Search Service proxy.

This allows you to create data repositories that automatically index the data on mutation
and then search against your stored entities.
