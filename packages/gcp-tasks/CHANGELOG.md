## 1.0.0

We are excited to announce the ESM-only library release of our cloud libraries, with a fun new name of [MondoKit](https://mondokit.dev/).

Libraries migrated from [gae-js](https://github.com/mondo-mob/gae-js).

See the [Migration Guide from GAE JS](https://mondokit.dev/migration-from-gae-js) for steps to migrate.
